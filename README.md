The repository contains a complete monocular visual odometry (VO) pipeline built as part of the course Vision Algorithms for Mobile Robotics (2016) according to the [task](task.pdf).
The pipeline relies on the input of a single visual sensor mounted on a driving vehicle to estimate a trajectory which is valid up to an unknown scale factor.

An overview and more details can be found in the [report](report.pdf).
