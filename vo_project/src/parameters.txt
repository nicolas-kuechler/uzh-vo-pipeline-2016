% This is an extensive list of parameters that are used in the pipeline

#?harris_patch_size:
size of patch over which intensity gradient is convoluted

#?harris_kappa:
parameter controlling harris score calculation

#?num_keypoints
number of key points which are computed during bootstrapping
 
#?nonmaximum_supression_radius
radius of suppression after selecting key point from harris score map

# descriptor_radius
radius of the descriptor patch used for matching keypoints during bootstrapping

# match_lambda
heuristic which discards matches which are not strong enough during bootstrapping

# triangulation_angle_threshold
angle threshold between bearing vectors for candidate key points at which
triangulation takes place. 

# surpress_existing_matches
a flag controlling whether harris scores should be suppressed by existing 
matched key points before new keypoint selection.

# candidate_cap
maximum number of tracked candidates

# add_candidate_each_frame
number of candidates that are added in each frame

# triangulate_max_repr_error
maximum average reprojection error that is allowed after triangulating
candidates. Landmarks with higher errors are discarded.

# runBA
flag controlling whether bundle adjustment should take place or not

# alignment
flag controlling whether ground truth alignment should take place or not

# critical_kp
If matched keypoints fall below this value newly triangulated landmarks
with too high reprojection errors are no longer discarded. 

# tracker_max_bidirectional_error
Maximum allowable error in KLT tracking for key points to still be considered
tracked 

# tracker_blocksize
pixel block around tracked key point used to determine the transformation
of the KLT tracker

# ransac_num_iterations
number of iterations run by p3p RANSAC

# ransac_pixel_tolerance
inlier tolerance for p3p RANSAC

#?ba_frequency
frequency of BA in frames
