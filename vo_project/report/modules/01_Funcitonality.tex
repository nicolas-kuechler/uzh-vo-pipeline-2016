\chapter{Functionality of our VO Pipeline}
The main functionality of the VO Pipeline can summarized in the following points:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Loading the datasets.
  \item Boostrapping the first and third image from the data set. This generates an initial point cloud, corresponding matched key points and the initial camera pose of the third image. 
  \item Process each subsequent image by tracking previous keypoints, finding the new camera pose, finding new keypoints and point clouds.
\end{itemize}

These points will be summarized in the following paragraphs.
