\section{Error Analysis of Params}

\subsection{error}
- plots
- discussion
- example bullshit argument: as maximum reprojection error is increased the error grows as more outliers are included in the estimation of the landmarks and homographies.

\subsection{timing}
- plot (optional)
- discussion
- example bullshit argument: As can be seen the error declines with increasing ransac iterations. However, this trend is contrasted by a increasing operation burden on the CPU.






As can be seen in Fig \ref{fig:overview} scale drift is a problem
